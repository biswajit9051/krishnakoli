				A brand started by Priyanka Sarkar, whose love for fashion finally gets to be shared with all of you.
			</p>
			<h3>About The Owner:</h3>
			<p>
				Priyanka Sarkar, originally from Durgapur, now resides in College Street, Kolkata after marriage. She had always had a huge love for different kinds of clothing and jewellery, and would always help her friends and relatives with great fashion advice. Priyanka had always wanted to do more about her passion, but being a homemaker and mother of one, she never got the time to follow her dream. However, when the world came to a standstill with the lockdown, she thought that now is the right time to finally begin what she had always wanted to do. With a lot of hard work and dedication, Krishnakoli was born.
